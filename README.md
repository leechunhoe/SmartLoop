Music looping reinvented

I like to have music turned on when I am working. But the problem is, I have to frequently reselect songs, due to boring "loop-all" when I have hundreds of song in the music folder.
I don't like random looping either, because unpredictability makes me frustrated.

So I think of compromise between these two: Progressive looping. For example, I have 100 songs, I loop 10 songs per cycle. At the next cycle I progress by 1, i.e. the next loop start from second song. The loops goes on.

This way is good that I can repeat each songs I love for enough frequency and at the same time I don't get bored of it.
