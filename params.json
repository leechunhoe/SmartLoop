{"name":"Smartloop","tagline":"Incremental Playlist Looping","body":"# SmartLoop - Music looping reinvented\r\n\r\nThis program is to solve one of the biggest frustration faced by music listeners - LOOPING.\r\n\r\nMost standard music players provide 3 kinds of looping: LOOP ONE, LOOP ALL, RANDOM. But here is the problem: We don't really adapt well into either of them. Some of us tend to repeat one or a few songs that we love over the rest, until we bored of it, then manually search for the rest. Random looping does not work well either because we (or is it just me?) somehow need predictability of the order of songs, to feel comfortable.\r\n\r\nThere is a way to get the best of both worlds from CHAOS (random looping) and ORDER (ordered looping):\r\n\r\nINCREMENTAL LOOPING\r\n\r\nHow it works:\r\nFor example, I have 102 songs. The list start with the first song. When it loops until 10th, it loops back to 2nd song (instead of 1st) so that the loop is incremented by one, i.e. next loop will have 11th song. And et cetera.\r\n\r\nThis way of looping is to ensure you listen to each songs for optimal frequency: Satisfied but not bored, and you can get to enjoy all tracks in your playlist without need to worry about what song to play next.\r\n\r\n[Download DMG](https://github.com/zen0625/SmartLoop/blob/master/SmartLoop.dmg)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
