{"name":"Smartloop","tagline":"Incremental Playlist Looping","body":"# SmartLoop - Music looping reinvented\r\n\r\nI like to have music turned on when I am working. But the problem is, I have to frequently reselect songs, due to boring \"loop-all\" when I have hundreds of song in the music folder.\r\nI don't like random looping either, because unpredictability makes me frustrated.\r\n\r\nSo I think of compromise between these two: Progressive looping. For example, I have 100 songs, I loop 10 songs per cycle. At the next cycle I progress by 1, i.e. the next loop start from second song. The loops goes on.\r\n\r\nThis way is good that I can repeat each songs I love for enough frequency and at the same time I don't get bored of it\r\n\r\n[Download DMG](https://github.com/zen0625/SmartLoop/blob/master/SmartLoop.dmg)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
